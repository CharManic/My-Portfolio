<hr/>

<h3> Interstellar </h3>

<p> This has to be my favourite film. It's extremely beautiful and it has an extremely well-designed storyline. </p>

<h3> The Hunger Games Series </h3>

<p> I might be cheating here, but the Hunger Games are a fantastic series (especially the newest one). </p>

<h3> No Time to Die </h3>

<p> Outstanding film with lots of action and a very sad ending.  </p>
