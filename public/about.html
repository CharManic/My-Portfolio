      <p> 
        Hey there. Charlie here, nice to meet you. I am from the UK, and I am currently 14 (soon to turn 15). 
        I attend a local secondary school, and this is how I got to participate in DofE; I have already completed my Bronze Award, and I am on my way towards completing my Silver!

        My main hobby is writing; I tend to write online, but I also love just pulling up a Word document and using that instead. My favourite subjects are Mathematics and Computer Science, before others like Astronomy, Sciences, and English.

        Anyways, thanks for having a look at this! It's really appreciated!
